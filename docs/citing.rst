Citing PopPUNK
==============

If you use PopPUNK, PopPIPE or pp-sketchlib in a scientific paper, we would appreciate
a citation. As a minimum, please cite the following paper(s):

Lees JA, Harris SR, Tonkin-Hill G, Gladstone RA, Lo SW, Weiser JN, Corander J, Bentley SD, Croucher NJ. Fast and flexible
bacterial genomic epidemiology with PopPUNK. *Genome Research* **29**:1-13 (2019).
doi:`10.1101/gr.241455.118 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.241455.118>`__

Generating citations and methods
--------------------------------
You can add ``--citation`` to your PopPUNK command to generate a full list of papers
to cite. This will also produce a basic methods paragraph for you to edit and include. You
can do this after running `poppunk_assign` or `poppunk --fit-model`::

```

```


If your journal requires versions for all software packages, you may find running
``conda list`` helpful.
